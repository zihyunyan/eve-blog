I’m a third year Ph.D. student in psychology at New York University. I work with [Paul Glimcher](https://www.neuroeconomicslab.org/) to research the dynamic elationship between people’s risk preferences and their everyday life experiences. I am interested in studying how people make choices in an uncertain world and how our affective states affect our decision-making. 

Previously, I received an MSc by Research from the University of Pennsylvania, where I worked with Joe Kable to study underpining neural mechanism of emaphy. Before that, I completed my undergraduate degree at National Taiwan University.
