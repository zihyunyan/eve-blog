I’m currently a Ph.D. student in experimental psychology at New York University. I work with [Paul Glimcher](https://www.neuroeconomicslab.org/) to research the dynamic elationship between people’s risk preferences and their everyday life experiences. I am interested in studying how people make choices in an uncertain world and how our affective states affect our decision-making. 

Previously, I received a master of behavioral and decision sciences from the University of Pennsylvania, where I worked with [Joe Kable](http://www.kablelab.com/) to study the underlying neural mechanism of empathy. Before that, I completed my undergraduate degree at National Taiwan University.
